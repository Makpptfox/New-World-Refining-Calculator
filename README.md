<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About NWRC

![Exemple picture of NWRC](https://i.imgur.com/9T6Xhua.png)

<h3 align="center">NRWC is a Windows desktop app that do the maths part of the refining process of New World with a bit of ergonomy added to it. The main rule while developping it was and is KISS! (Keep It Stupid Simple) without giving away some useful features and a decent GUI.</h3>
<br />
<h3 align="center">I'm fully aware that there's Google Sheets out there doing kind of the same thing, but I just don't like the ergonomy of them (and the ram usage of my webbrowser) so here is a free and open different take!</h3>

<br />
<br />

### The App:

* The 5 Refining lifeskill of the game are listed on the left, a simple click on them and you can view a list of the relevants items that you can craft just on the right of it.

* A simple click on "Add" under the item you want to list will add it on the work space.

* Edit the amount of any item in the main row.

* Drag the main row of any item you've selected in the order you desire.

* Click on the double bottom arrow under any item in the main row to see what are the lower grade items you need to get the desired amount of your initial item.

* Create and delete tabs to keep your workspace clear. (max of 5 tabs and 18 chars max for the name of said tab. You can't edit nor delete the Default tab)

* Stonecutting being a big (probably biggest than the other 4 combined) refining lifeskill, its UI is a bit different.

* Pressing Stonecutting will list all Blocks, Bricks, Keys, Orbs to craft.

* Upon pressing Stonecutting 2 lists while dropdown under it on the left, those are the Gemstones tabs, they're listed by rarity and if they're either UNCUT or CUT.

* The app support only English and French as of the time of writing this.
